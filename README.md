# Elevator_Project
 
This project is to test my Python abilities and create a working elevator that picks people up and drops them off on the correct floor using a Hashmap data structure through Python's dictionaries. You can input the number of people you want to be picked up/dropped off as well as editing their values, IE the floor they are on and the floor they want to go to.
